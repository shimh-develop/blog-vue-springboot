a CSS selector compiler/engine

## What?

css-select turns CSS selectors into functions that tests if elements match them.
When searching for elements, testing is executed "from the top", similar to how
browsers execute CSS selectors.

In its default configuration, css-select queries the DOM structure of the
[`domhandler`](https://github.com/fb55/domhandler) module (also known as
htmlparser2 DOM). It uses [`domutils`](https://github.com/fb55/domutils) as its
default adapter over the DOM structure. See Options below for details on
querying alternative DOM structures.

**Features:**

-   Full implementation of CSS3 selectors
-   Partial implementation of jQuery/Sizzle extensions
-   Very high test coverage
-   Pretty good performance

## Why?

The traditional approach of executing CSS selectors, named left-to-right
execution, is to execute every component of the selector in order, from left to
right _(duh)_. The execution of the selector `a b` for example will first query
for `a` elements, then search these for `b` elements. (That's the approach of
eg. [`Sizzle`](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle),
[`nwmatcher`](https://github.com/dperini/nwmatcher/) and
[`qwery`](https://github.com/ded/qwery).)

While this works, it has some downsides: Children of `a`s will be checked
multiple times; first, to check if they are also `a`s, then, for every superior
`a` once, if they are `b`s. Using
[Big O notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), that would be
`O(n^(k+1))`, where `k` is the number of descendant selectors (that's the space
in the example above).

The far more efficient approach is to first look for `b` elements, then check if
they have superior `a` elements: Using big O notation again, that would be
`O(n)`. That's called right-to-left execution.

And that's what css-select does â€“ and why it's quite performant.

## How does it work?

By building a stack of functions.

_Wait, what?_

Okay, so let's suppose we want to compile the selector `a b` again, for
right-to-left execution. We start by _parsing_ the selector, which means we turn
the selector into an array of the building-blocks of the selector, so we can
distinguish them easily. That's what the
[`css-what`](https://github.com/fb55/css-what) module is for, if you want to
have a look.

Anyway, after parsing, we end up with an array like this one:

```js
[
    { type: "tag", name: "a" },
    { type: "descendant" },
    { type: "tag", name: "b" },
];
```

Actually, this array is wrapped in another array, but that's another story
(involving commas in selectors).

Now that we know the meaning of every part of the selector, we can compile it.
That's where it becomes interesting.

The basic idea is to turn every part of the selector into a function, which
takes an element as its only argument. The function checks whether a passed
element matches its part of the selector: If it does, the element is passed to
the next turned-into-a-function part of the selector, which does the same. If an
element is accepted by all parts of the selector, it _matches_ the selector and
double rainbow ALL THE WAY.

As said before, we want to do right-to-left execution with all the big O
improvements nonsense, so elements are passed from the rightmost part of the
selector (`b` in our example) to the leftmost (~~which would be `c`~~ of course
`a`).

_//TODO: More in-depth description. Implementation details. Build a spaceship._

## API

```js
const CSSselect = require("css-select");
```

**Note:** css-select throws errors when invalid selectors are passed to it,
contrary to the behavior in browsers, which swallow them. This is done to aid
with writing css selectors, but can be unexpected when processing arbitrary
strings.

#### `CSSselect.selectAll(query, elems, options)`

Queries `elems`, returns an array containing all matches.

-   `query` can be either a CSS selector or a function.
-   `elems` can be either an array of elements, or a single element. If it is an
    element, its children will be queried.
-   `options` is described below.

Aliases: `default` export, `CSSselect.iterate(query, elems)`.

#### `CSSselect.compile(query, options)`

Compiles the query, returns a function.

#### `CSSselect.is(elem, query, options)`

Tests whether or not an element is matched by `query`. `query` can be either a
CSS selector or a function.

#### `CSSselect.selectOne(query, elems, options)`

Arguments are the same as for `CSSselect.selectAll(query, elems)`. Only returns
the first match, or `null` if there was no match.

### Options

All options are optional.

-   `xmlMode`: When enabled, tag names will be case-sensitive. Default: `false`.
-   `rootFunc`: The last function in the stack, will be called with the last
    element that's looked at.
-   `adapter`: The adapter to use when interacting with the backing DOM
    structure. By default it uses the `domutils` module.
-   `context`: The context of the current query. Used to limit the scope of
    searches. Can be matched directly using the `:scope` pseudo-selector.
-   `cacheResults`: Allow css-select to cache results for some selectors,
    sometimes greatly improving querying performance. Disable this if your
    document can change in between queries with the same compiled selector.
    Default: `true`.

#### Custom Adapters

A custom adapter must match the interface described
[here](https://github.com/fb55/css-select/blob/1aa44bdd64aaf2ebdfd7f338e2e76bed36521957/src/types.ts#L6-L96).

You may want to have a look at [`domutils`](https://github.com/fb55/domutils) to
see the default implementation, or at
[`css-select-browser-adapter`](https://github.com/nrkn/css-select-browser-adapter/blob/master/index.js)
for an implementation backed by the DOM.
